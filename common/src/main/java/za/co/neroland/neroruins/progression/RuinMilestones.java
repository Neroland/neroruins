/**
 * The progression signals NeroRuins publishes through Neroland Core, in one place, so future structure
 * code only has to call a method here and the quest pack that ships with this jar needs no further code.
 *
 * <h2>Personal milestones — player-scope record gates</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each gate is a data file under {@code data/neroruins/neroland_gates/} with {@code "scope": "player"}
 * and no {@code requires}. They <em>record</em> that a player did something; they gate nothing and are
 * never checked for access (vault locks and puzzle doors keep their own logic).
 *
 * <table>
 *   <tr><th>Gate</th><th>Call</th><th>When</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@code neroruins:first_log}</td><td>{@link #firstLog}</td>
 *       <td>a player reads a data log for the first time</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@code neroruins:first_vault}</td><td>{@link #firstVault}</td>
 *       <td>a player opens a locked vault</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@code neroruins:puzzle_solver}</td><td>{@link #puzzleSolver}</td>
 *       <td>a puzzle door opens for the player who completed it</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@code neroruins:temple_cleared}</td><td>{@link #templeCleared}</td>
 *       <td>the last guardian of a temple dies — call once per player who damaged it</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>Opening an already-open gate is a no-op in Core, so callers need not de-duplicate.
 *
 * <h2>World milestone — the {@code neroruins:vault_claimed} channel</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #vaultClaimed} counts claimed vaults per structure <em>type</em> in the {@link VaultLedger}
 * and fires a {@link ThresholdCrossing} on Core's bus each time that type's count reaches a rung
 * ({@link #RUNGS}: 1, 10, 50). The crossing's scope is the structure type id (for example
 * {@code neroruins:lava_temple}); its value is the type's new count. A crossing can never credit one
 * player, which is exactly why the personal milestones above are gates instead.
 *
 * <p><b>Privacy (POPIA/GDPR):</b> the channel scope is a structure type, never a player name, a UUID
 * or coordinates (a ruin's position plus a time can locate a player). The player reference goes only
 * into {@code ProgressionGates.open}. Nothing here logs who.
 *
 * <p>Every method is safe to call from gameplay code: a Core failure is logged (without the player) and
 * swallowed, so a progression hiccup never breaks a vault or a door.
