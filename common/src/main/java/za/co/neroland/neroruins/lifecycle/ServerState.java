/**
 * The one place NeroRuins learns that a server started or stopped, invoked from each loader's own
 * lifecycle hook (the same shape the sibling Neroland mods use).
 *
 * <p>Neroland Core's gate events hand a listener a player UUID string and nothing else — no server,
 * no level — so code reacting to them needs somewhere to find the running server. {@link #serverStarted}
 * records it and {@link #serverStopped} forgets it, so a lookup before the first world is loaded (or
 * after the last one closed) honestly answers "nothing" instead of guessing from a stale reference.
 * In single-player the JVM outlives the world, which is why the reference must be cleared.
 *
 * <p><b>Privacy (POPIA/GDPR):</b> nothing here holds, logs or clears player data.
