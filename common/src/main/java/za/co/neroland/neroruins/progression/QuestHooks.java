/**
 * The two <b>hook gates</b> a quest pack may name as a {@code mod_hook} reward, and what happens when
 * one opens.
 *
 * <p>A quest mod that wants to say "this player finished a quest of yours" opens the record gate
 * {@code neroruins:hook/<id>} for that player through Neroland Core — online or offline — and this
 * class listens on Core's gate events, applies the effect to that player, and closes the gate again to
 * re-arm it. Nothing here imports a quest mod; the pack is inert data and the only contract is Core's.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #REVEAL_RUIN} — will give the player a one-use survey map to the nearest unclaimed ruin
 *       in their current dimension (shown only to them).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #UNLOCK_LOG} — will unlock one lore entry in the player's data-log archive.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Placeholder effects.</b> NeroRuins has no structures, survey maps or data-log archive yet, so
 * each hook currently sends the player one translatable chat line ({@code hook.neroruins.<id>.placeholder})
 * and re-arms. The real effects land with the content; {@link #apply} is the single seam to replace.
 *
 * <p>A hook that opens while the player is offline stays open; {@link #onJoin} delivers it the next time
 * they log in. Hook gates gate nothing and are never checked for access. Effects are idempotent per
 * opening and bounded: a quest completion is not a payment rail.
 *
 * <p><b>Privacy (POPIA/GDPR):</b> the change's target is a player UUID, used only to find the online
 * player and to re-arm the gate through Core; it is never logged.
