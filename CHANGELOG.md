## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0-alpha.1] - 2026-10-11

Progression seams and a quest pack, ahead of the structures. Requires **Neroland Core 1.15.0**. No
gameplay content yet: the quests below become completable once ruins, vaults, puzzle doors, guardians
and relics exist.

### Added

- **NeroQuests quest pack.** Ships chapter `neroruins:expedition_notes` "Expedition Notes", 7 quests
  (5 player, 2 server-scope world-log), that appears in the quest book when NeroQuests is installed;
  inert otherwise, no dependency. Quests read the record gates and channel below, plus a
  `collect_item` on the `neroruins:relics` tag. Rewards are experience, a few plain items and two
  `mod_hook` rewards.
- **Record gates** (`data/neroruins/neroland_gates/`, player scope, no `requires`, never checked for
  access): `first_log`, `first_vault`, `puzzle_solver`, `temple_cleared`, and the hook gates
  `hook/reveal_ruin` and `hook/unlock_log`.
- **`progression.RuinMilestones`** — the one place future structure code reports progress:
  `firstLog` / `firstVault` / `puzzleSolver` / `templeCleared(ServerPlayer)` open the record gates, and
  `vaultClaimed(server, structureTypeId)` counts claimed vaults per structure type and fires the
  threshold channel **`neroruins:vault_claimed`** (scope = structure type id, rungs 1 / 10 / 50) on
  Neroland Core's bus. Counts persist in the new `neroruins:vault_ledger` saved-data store, loaded
  through Core's crash-safe `SavedDataRecovery`.
- **`progression.QuestHooks`** — listens on Core's gate events for the two hook gates, delivers to the
  online player (or on their next join, via each loader's player-join hook) and re-arms the gate.
  Placeholder effect until the content exists: one translatable chat line per hook. The survey-map
  (`reveal_ruin`) and lore-archive (`unlock_log`) effects land with the structures.
- **`lifecycle.ServerState`** — records the running server from each loader's start/stop events so
  common code reacting to Core events can find it (and forgets it between single-player worlds).
- Item tag `neroruins:relics` (empty until relic items exist) and the mod's first `en_us.json`.
- Wiki page [`Expedition-Notes.md`](wiki/Expedition-Notes.md).

### Changed

- Neroland Core pin `1.13.0` → **`1.15.0`** (offline-capable `ProgressionGates.open/close/isOpen` and
  sourced `ThresholdEvents.fire`); the loader manifests' floor follows it automatically.
- Privacy: no new personal data. Personal milestones live in Core's player-scope gate store (covered
  by Core's privacy notes and erasure hook); the vault ledger holds structure type ids and counts
  only; the channel scope is a structure type, never a player or a position. `PRIVACY.md` notes it.

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-09-24

EMI compatibility. No gameplay, id, tag or config change.

### Added

- **EMI support.** NeroRuins adds no recipes of its own, so nothing needed a plugin. The build now
  compiles against the community EMI Unofficial Port (Unstable), the only EMI build for Minecraft 26.x,
  and dev clients load it with `-PwithEmi` (default runs stay JEI-only). EMI stays optional.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-09-20

Minecraft **26.3** support. No gameplay, id, tag or config change.

### Added

- **Minecraft 26.3** as a new Stonecutter node on every loader — NeoForge `26.3.0.7-beta`,
  Forge `26.3-66.0.2` and Fabric (fabric-api `0.161.0+26.3`, NeoForm `26.3-1`) — built alongside
  26.1.2 and 26.2, so every release now ships **nine** loader × version jars.

### Changed

- VS Code run/debug configurations (`.vscode/launch.json`, `.vscode/tasks.json`) gain the three
  26.3 cells; the "Build all" task now builds all nine.
- CI (`multiloader.yml`, `publish.yml`) builds, attaches and publishes the 26.3 jars.
- JEI pins moved to the newest published builds on each Minecraft version: `29.40.0.101` (26.1.2), `30.35.0.223` (26.2) and `31.3.0.18` (26.3). Compile-time API only — JEI remains a soft dependency and the shipped jar gains no hard requirement.

### 26.3 port notes

- Build: the shared `common/` Java source is now preprocessed by Stonecutter for every non-active node (`stonecutterProcessCommon`), so common code can carry `//? if >=26.3 {` blocks, and `common/src/main/resources-<mc>` overlay folders are merged over the shared resources for matching nodes (`mergeCommonResources`). The active node still compiles the raw `common/` folder.
- Build plugins aligned with Neroland Core: ModDevGradle `2.0.147` (the older 2.0.141 cannot set up NeoForge 26.3), ForgeGradle `7.0.40`, Stonecutter `0.9.8`.
